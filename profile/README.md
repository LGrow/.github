# 🐹 LGrow, the most simplified high-performance language!

- Before, we needed to make this presentation, since this character is VERY important to our story. Since it was and will forever be our first mascot.

# So, let's get to the beginning!

**A language designed for ease, compiled and low level, incredible speed compared to other languages.**

We don't want to turn our ease of use into a joke, so we will use simple and clear syntaxes, similar to JavaScript, Python or GOLang. Of course, we will do the aforementioned with incomparable speed.

**See below a simple use of the language:**

# How does language work?
- **Compiler:** 

The compiler is written in C and saves some data from the language's standard modules, which are written in Rust or Assembly. There are no tricks, there are compilation phases like those in other languages.

<br>

- **Executables:** 

The executables generated by LGrow have the same ByteCode as Rust or Assembly, a high-performance executable, including LIBS used within the code, thus making them Rust(or assembly) executables.
